#Hi again,
#
#I did some more troubleshooting, and I now have the feeling that the driver 
#isn't doing exactly what it should.
#
#First of all, a disclaimer: I am no developer and I know next to nothing 
#about the USB protocol, so please don't be too harsh on me if what I am 
#saying is complete BS.
#
#Now, I wrote a small python script to try to read data from the WS-3000 and 
#I actually managed to get this working fine. So I can safely confirm that 
#the problem doesn't come from the hardware or from the host. The setup I am 
#using is working fine, the issue must be coming from weewx or the HP3000 
#driver.
#
#According to the output from Wireshark and from what I've read in the 
#driver's code, I *believe* that there are two issues:
#1. one is that the driver is sending commands using the 'control' channel.
#2. probably not directly related to the error I am seeing, but I don't 
#understand the point of sending all the 0x41, 0x06, 0x08, 0x09, 0x05, 0x03, 
#0x04 commands. The only interesting ones are 0x03 (current data) and 0x05 
#(calibration, assuming it must be taken into account to get the 'corrected' 
#temperature).

#You can find the small script I wrote attached. The only problem I have is 
#that I have to unplug and replug the station between each run, I probably 
#don't reset everything properly.
#You can easily compare the output when sending each of the 0x41, 0x06, 
#0x08, 0x09, 0x05, 0x03, 0x04 commands, or when sending only 0x03 commands. 
#By the way, this also means that contrary to what is mentioned in the 
#driver, the correct way to distinguish between current data and calibration 
#data is to keep track of which command was sent...
#
#Please let me know if this makes sense or not. I am willing to do any 
#additional test you need in order to get this working correctly.
#
#Thanks a lot.

# Changelog
# v1 Original script. Written for Python2 by original author Olivier Guyotot
# v2 Tiny tweaks to make the script run with Python3. Mainly around arguments to print. 28.12.2018 Thomas Frivold
# v3 Added numpy arrays and Pandas Dataframes 28.12.2018 Thomas Frivold
# v4 Commented out all the pandas stuff. Added Time and Random number, to make it easy to see that the script is running in a loop.
